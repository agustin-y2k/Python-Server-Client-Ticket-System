## Database

A relational type database was used, more precisely MySQL.
This decision is based on the fact that SQL databases are the most used by the developer community, it also has a large
amount of documentation and threads in forums with solutions to problems that usually happen.

## ORM

SQLAlchemy was used because:

-It is completely developed in Python.

-Abstraction of the model without worrying about the database engine used.

-SQLAlchemy helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities

## Sockets

-socket.AF_INET
Enables communication between server and clients.
AF_INTET It is related to the IPV4 protocol. When using AF_INET sockets, bind the server to "localhost".

-socket.SOCK_STREAM
STREAM is related to the TCP protocol.

## getopt

Module used to do operations by command. This module takes three arguments:

- The first parameter is the sequence of arguments to parse. This usually comes from sys.argv[1:]

- The second argument is the option definition string for single character options,
  if one of the options requires an argument, the letter is followed by two points

- The third argument, if used, should be a sequence of long option names. Long options can be more than a single character

## JSON

The json module was used so that the data exchanged between the server and the client was in JSON format.

## multiprocessing

The "multiprocessing" module was used to create the process in parallel to the execution of the system when the client
demands the operation of exporting Tickets.

## threading

The "threading" module was used to create threads for each client that connects, so that the server handles
independently to each of the clients.
